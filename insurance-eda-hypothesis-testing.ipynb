Median of the charges for both male and female as well as for regions seems to be similar visually and hence we can say that the charges are irrespective of the sex or region or age.\n- On the contrary, charges differs significantly for smoker person than non-smokers.\n- Out of four regions, maximum frequency of people is from southeast region (364), whereas majority of them are male (676) and non-smokers are more in number (1064/1338) having children of COVID-19 as No Children-0 (574) i.e persons with 0 children / less critical conditions are more in number than more critical conditions.\n- Although the persons who smokes tobacco are less in number as compared to non-smokers, the charges incurred by them are more.\n- Whereas, charges also differs with the children. As we can see that the persons with more Children seems to incur more charges as compared to less children. \n- As we can see from the population distribution plot for male and females, the number of persons are similar from both the groups. There's a slight increase in the charges for males than females which can be thought in terms of the slightly higher number of males getting admitted as compared to females. And this fact can be seen in the barplot where we focused more on age analysis as we found high correlation between age and charges from the heatmap.\n- As the age of the persons increases, the charges also increases as there might be few other complications along with ageing in older people.\n- There are comparatively less population of smokers to that of non smokers. Whereas, the charges and the bmi for smokers are way higher than that of non smokers.\n- The smokers with bmi greater than or equal to 30tends to spend more on charges and related expenditures. The non-smoker persons whose bmi is also greater than 30tends to spend less on the charges. This disparity can be thought in terms of the other health complications that are involved for the non-smokers due to increased bmi and it's impact on poor lungs.\n- The max charges for non smokers are around 75,000 whereas, for non smokers it goes till twice this amount i.e 150,000.\n- As we can see from the pairplot w.r.t region differentiation, persons coming from southeast regions has slightly higher bmi as compared to other three regions, also they bear higher charges as compared to others, whereas they have slightly higher population of aged persons.\n- The final observations from EDA regarding charges can be stated as- the charges incurred by people (male/female) in general from any of the regions who are smokers, are almost 5 times more than the people who don't smoke at all.\n- For all the regions, females who are non-smokers have more charges than that of non-smokers males. This might be due to low immunity power or some other complicated issues.\n- As concluded from the 2 sampled right tailed T test the average charges of smokers are greater than that of nonsmoker\n- As concluded from the 2 sampled right tailed T test the bmi of females is same as that of males.\n- As concluded from the One - way Annova test , the bmi of women with no children, 1 children and 2 children is same\n- As concluded from the Chi-Square test the smokers proportion is not significantly different in different regions.\n\n\n# Recommendations:\n- As the person with no Children are also spending a lot on charges, the insurance Management needs to allocate proper resources to the persons with more Children than to no / less children persons. \n\n- Persons who smokes are in dire need of insurance coverage and insurance 24/7 can recommend corporates with whom they have tie-ups that more focus should be on smoker population as they have high chance of getting infected with any disease. So the employer needs to encourage the employees who are smokers to get more health insurance coverage or at least increase or add some top up upon their existing coverage so that they won't get get shock after seeing the charges and the final bill. In addition to this, the employees who work for the employer with whom there's a tie up with insurance 24/7 hospitals, should ask or targeted campaign should be initiated with a focus to enroll their parent's and grandparents for the insurance schemes and policies. Similarly employer needs to encourage the female employees to get their insurance cover renewed to save themselves from additional financial crisis in case of any medical emergencies like COVID-19.\n\n- There should be some kind of awareness campaign to put a stop on smoking habits as it's clearly evident from the data that, smoker persons have spent extra money on health which can include, surgery, lung transplant, prolonged covid-19 infection, etc. The reason behind this is also clearly evident from the data of bmis of these smoker persons which is way higher than 30along with other complications as stated and proved in above summary points by comparing the smoker and non-smokers with bmi greater than 30. These points should be majorly focused and highlighted in the campaign.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
